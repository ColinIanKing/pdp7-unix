# pdp7-unix
This is a project to resurrect Unix on the PDP-7 from a scan of the original assembly code done by Norman Wilson.

Right now the scans are in the Unix Archive at http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/McIlroy_v0/
as the files 0*.pdf. We now need to convert these to machine-readable assembly code, write tools such as an assembler,
a filesystem creation tool, and write from scratch missing things like a shell, ls etc.
