NAME              cat -- concatenate and print

SYNOPSIS          cat file1 ...

DESCRIPTION       cat reads each file in sequence and writes it on the

                                  cat file

                  is about the easiest way to print a file. Also:

                     cat filel file2 >file3

                  is about the easiest way to concatenate files.

FILES
