SYNOPSIS          stat name

DESCRIPTION       stat gives several kinds of information about one file:
                  files:

                  All information is self-explanatory except the mode. The
                  mode is a five-character string whose characters mean the
                  following:

                     1   s: file is small (smaller than 4096 words)
                         l: file is large
                         d:    file is a directory

                     2   r: owner can read
                         -: owner cannot read

                     3   w: owner can write
                         -: owner cannot write

                     4   r: non-owner can read
                         -: non-owner cannot read

                     5   w: non-owner can write
                         -: non-owner cannot write

                  All numeric values are printed in octal
                  if he cannot be found in "/etc/uids" a number is given.
