NAME              format of directories

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION       A directory behaves exactly like an ordinary file, save
                  that no user may write into a directory. The fact that a
                  file is a directory is indicated by a bit in the flag word
                  of its i-node entry.

                  Directory entries are 8 words long. The first word is the
                  i-node of the file represented by the entry, if non-zero;
                  if zero, the entry is empty.

                  Words 1-4 represent the (8-character) file name, space
                  padded on the right. These words are not necessarily
                  cleared for empty slots.

                  By convention, the first entry in each directory is
                  for "dd", which is the "directory directory" that holds
		  all the users' home directories and the "system" directory.
		  The "system" directory contains "init" and "sh".
