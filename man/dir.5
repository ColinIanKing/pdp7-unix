SYNOPSIS	--
.sp
DESCRIPTION	A directory behaves exactly like an ordinary
	file, save that no user may write into a
	directory. The fact that a file is a directory
	is indicated by a bit in the flag word of its
	i-node entry.
.sp
	Directory entries are 8 words long. The first
	word is the i-node of the file represented by
	the entry, if non-zero; if zero, the entry is
	empty.
.sp
	Words 1-4 represent the (8-character) file name,
	space padded on the right. These words are not
	necessarily cleared for empty slots.
.sp
	By convention, the first entry in each directory
	is for "dd", which is the "directory directory"
	that holds all the users' home directories and
	the "system" directory. The "system" directory
	contains "init" and "sh".
